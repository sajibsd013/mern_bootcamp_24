# HTML & CSS Learning Resources

## Introduction

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies for building web pages. HTML structures the content, while CSS styles it. This guide will help you understand both technologies thoroughly.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need a text editor and a web browser. Here are some recommended tools:

- Text Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Web Browser: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)

## HTML Basics

### What is HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements.

### Basic Structure

Every HTML document has a basic structure that includes the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
