# JavaScript Lecture Outline (part-1)

## Variables and Data Types

### Concepts:
- **Variables**: `var`, `let`, `const`
- **Data Types**: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Symbol`, `Object` (basic introduction)

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Create a program that stores your favorite book's title, the year it was published, and whether you've read it or not. Print out a sentence using these variables, e.g., "My favorite book is '1984', published in 1949, and I have read it: true."

## Operators

### Concepts:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Take the length and width as variables, and use arithmetic operators to find the area (`length * width`) and perimeter (`2 * (length + width)`).

## Control Structure

### Concepts:
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, `else`
- **Switch Statements**: `switch` statement for multiple conditions
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements. Additionally, use a `switch` statement to print the grade ("A", "B", "C", etc.) based on a numerical score input (90-100: "A", 80-89: "B", etc.).

## If-Else

### Concepts:
- **If Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true
- **Else Statement**: Executes a block of code if the same condition is false
- **Else If Statement**: Specifies a new condition if the first condition is false

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that asks the user for their age and tells them whether they are a child (under 12), a teenager (13-19), an adult (20-64), or a senior (65 and older) using `if-else if-else`.

---

## Loops

### Concepts:
- **For Loop**: Loop through a block of code a number of times
- **While Loop**: Loop through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- **Do...While Loop**: Loop through a block of code once, and then repeat the loop as long as a specified condition is true

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that prints out the multiplication table for a given number using a `for` loop. Use a `while` loop to sum all numbers from 1 to 100. Finally, use a `do...while` loop to count down from 10 to 1.

---

## Array

### Concepts:
- **Creating Arrays**: Using `[]` to create arrays
- **Accessing Elements**: Accessing elements using index
- **Array Methods**: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that creates an array of your favorite movies. Add two more movies to the list using `push`, remove the first movie using `shift`, and then use `map` to print each movie title in uppercase.

---

## String

### Concepts:
- **String Creation**: Using quotes to create strings
- **String Methods**: `length`, `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `charAt`, `substring`, `slice`, `split`, `indexOf`, `includes`

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a program that takes a sentence as input and returns the number of vowels in the sentence. Use string methods to convert the string to lowercase and then count the vowels.

---

## Function

### Concepts:
- **Function Declaration**: Using the `function` keyword to declare a function
- **Function Parameters and Arguments**: Passing data to functions
- **Return Values**: Returning a value from a function
- **Anonymous Functions**: Functions without a name
- **Arrow Functions**: ES6 syntax for writing functions

### Problem-Solving Exercise:
- **Problem**: Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum. Then, write another function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. Implement both as regular functions and arrow functions.
